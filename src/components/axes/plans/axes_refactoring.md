# Axes System Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines a comprehensive refactoring of our axes system to create a more cohesive, reusable, and consistent approach to both 2D and 3D visualizations. The goal is to establish a clear separation of concerns while ensuring proper coordination between related components like axes, grids, and coordinate systems.

## Current Challenges

1. **Inconsistent Implementation**: Our current 2D axes are implemented differently from how we need to approach 3D axes.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Axes, grids, and coordinate systems are often tightly coupled, making reuse difficult.
3. **Visualization vs. Transformation**: Coordinate systems currently handle transformations but not their visual representation.
4. **Lack of Standardization**: No consistent pattern for how axes should interact with other components.

## Proposed Architecture

We propose a new architecture with the following components:

### 1. Coordinate System Components (Existing)

- `CartesianCoordinateSystem`
- `Cartesian3DCoordinateSystem`
- `SphericalCoordinateSystem`
- etc.

These will continue to handle transformations, scales, and projections but will not be responsible for their visual representation.

### 2. Coordinate System Visualization Components (New)

- `CoordinateSystemVisualizer2D`
- `CoordinateSystemVisualizer3D`

These components will be responsible for visualizing coordinate systems, including:
- Axes
- Grids
- Labels
- Ticks
- Other visual elements

### 3. Individual Axis Components (Refactored/New)

- `Axis2D`
- `Axis3D`

These will be responsible for rendering individual axes with:
- Line
- Ticks
- Labels
- Formatting

### 4. Grid Components (New)

- `Grid2D`
- `Grid3D`

These will handle rendering grid lines or planes.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Design and Interface Definition

1. Define clear interfaces for all components
2. Establish communication patterns between components
3. Create design documents for each component

### Phase 2: Implement 3D Components

1. Implement `Axis3D` component
2. Implement `Grid3D` component
3. Implement `CoordinateSystemVisualizer3D` component

### Phase 3: Refactor 2D Components

1. Refactor existing axis code into `Axis2D` component
2. Implement `Grid2D` component
3. Implement `CoordinateSystemVisualizer2D` component

### Phase 4: Integration

1. Update existing visualizations to use new components
2. Ensure backward compatibility
3. Create examples demonstrating the new system

## Component Details

### CoordinateSystemVisualizer2D

```typescript
interface CoordinateSystemVisualizer2DOptions {
  coordinateSystem: CoordinateSystem;
  showAxes: boolean;
  showGrid: boolean;
  xAxisOptions?: Axis2DOptions;
  yAxisOptions?: Axis2DOptions;
  gridOptions?: Grid2DOptions;
}
```

### CoordinateSystemVisualizer3D

```typescript
interface CoordinateSystemVisualizer3DOptions {
  coordinateSystem: Cartesian3DCoordinateSystem | SphericalCoordinateSystem;
  showAxes: boolean;
  showGrid: boolean;
  xAxisOptions?: Axis3DOptions;
  yAxisOptions?: Axis3DOptions;
  zAxisOptions?: Axis3DOptions;
  gridOptions?: Grid3DOptions;
}
```

### Axis2D/3D

```typescript
interface AxisOptions {
  scale: Scale;
  orientation: string; // 'x', 'y', 'z', 'radial', etc.
  position: number | Point | Point3D;
  length: number;
  color: string;
  tickSize: number;
  tickCount: number;
  tickFormat: (value: any) => string;
  label: string;
  labelPosition: string | Point | Point3D;
}
```

### Grid2D/3D

```typescript
interface GridOptions {
  xScale?: Scale;
  yScale?: Scale;
  zScale?: Scale;
  xLines?: number[];
  yLines?: number[];
  zLines?: number[];
  color: string;
  opacity: number;
  lineWidth: number;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility.
2. **Reusability**: Components can be used in different contexts.
3. **Consistency**: Similar patterns for 2D and 3D visualizations.
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize individual aspects.
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and extend.

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 3 weeks
- Phase 3: 3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks

Total: 10 weeks

## Conclusion

This refactoring will significantly improve our axes and coordinate system visualization capabilities. By clearly separating concerns and establishing consistent patterns, we'll make it easier to create, customize, and maintain both 2D and 3D visualizations.
