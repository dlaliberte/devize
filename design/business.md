My prompt:  Your example-preview elements for each visualization are static renderings that appear to be equivalent to what we would generate with devize.   It would be great if we could optionally pregenerate a static rendering on the server side for any viz, for anything that doesn't require generation on the client side.  Sometimes the rendered elements will be larger than the code used to render them, in which case there would not be as much value for loading time.  However, then people could generate visualizations to send in email, for example.   I wonder how hard it would be to set up such a service.  Providing this as a service for those who want to pay for it would be a great way to fund the project.

Generating images that are snapshots of the rendered elements would be another very useful feature.  We could generate these with playwright.  Actually, we could probably use playwright to generate the static elements as well.

Your response:
Server-Side Rendering for Visualizations
Server-side rendering (SSR) for visualizations would indeed be valuable for several use cases:

Email-friendly visualizations: Static images that can be embedded in emails
Faster initial page loads: Pre-rendered visualizations reduce client-side computation
SEO benefits: Search engines can index the visual content
Social media sharing: Generate preview images for sharing on social platforms
Implementation Approach
Here's how we could implement this:

Server Renderer Service
 *
 * Purpose: Provides server-side rendering for Devize visualizations

API Service for Visualization Rendering
We could create a service that exposes this functionality via an API:

/**
 * Rendering Service
 *
 * Purpose: API service for rendering visualizations


Business Model for Rendering Service
This could indeed be monetized in several ways:

Tiered API access:

Free tier: Limited requests per day, basic formats
Pro tier: Higher limits, all formats, priority rendering
Enterprise tier: Custom limits, SLA, dedicated support
Integration options:

CMS plugins (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)
Email marketing platform integrations
Dashboard embedding services
Specialized rendering services:

High-resolution renders for print
Animated visualization exports
Interactive visualization embedding
