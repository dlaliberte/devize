# Codebase Reorganization Plan: Documentation Hierarchy

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a hierarchical documentation structure throughout the codebase. We will add `plans`, `docs`, `designs`, and `tests` folders to each directory of code, creating a consistent documentation hierarchy at all levels. This structure will improve maintainability, facilitate better context discovery for AI coding assistants, and ensure documentation stays close to the code it describes.

## Directory Structure Implementation

We will create the following directories at each level of the codebase:

- **plans/** - Planning documents, roadmaps, implementation strategies
- **docs/** - User documentation, API documentation, usage examples
- **designs/** - Architecture diagrams, design decisions, UI/UX designs
- **tests/** - Test plans, test cases, testing strategies (separate from actual test code)

This structure will be replicated at the top level and in each subdirectory containing code.

## Document Migration Strategy

### 1. Inventory Current Documentation

- Identify all existing documentation files
- Categorize them according to the new structure (plans, docs, designs, tests)
- Create an inventory spreadsheet tracking:
  - Current location
  - Document type
  - Target location
  - Dependencies/references

### 2. Migration Process

- Move top-level documents to appropriate subdirectories
- Update all references to maintain integrity
- Implement the reference system in each file
- Prioritize moving documents that are most frequently accessed

## Reference System Implementation

For each code file, we will add a standardized reference section:

```
## References
- **Plans**: /path/to/directory/plans/relevant_plan.md
- **Documentation**: /path/to/directory/docs/relevant_doc.md
- **Design**: /path/to/directory/designs/relevant_design.md
- **Tests**: /path/to/directory/tests/relevant_test.js
- **Related Code**: /path/to/related_code_file.js
```

This reference system will:
- Help developers quickly find related documentation
- Provide AI coding assistants with relevant context
- Create a web of connections throughout the codebase
- Ensure documentation is discoverable

## Documentation Structure Guidelines

### plans/
- Planning documents
- Roadmaps
- Implementation strategies
- Future enhancements
- Task breakdowns

### docs/
- User documentation
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Tutorials
- Troubleshooting guides

### designs/
- Architecture diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- UI/UX designs
- Design decisions and rationales
- Technical specifications

### tests/
- Test plans
- Test cases
- Testing strategies
- Test coverage reports
- QA procedures

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Structure Creation (Week 1-2)
- Create the directory structure
- Define templates for each document type
- Establish naming conventions
- Create initial placeholder files

### Phase 2: Document Migration (Week 3-4)
- Move existing documents to appropriate locations
- Update internal references
- Create placeholder files where documentation is missing
- Validate all links and references

### Phase 3: Reference Implementation (Week 5-6)
- Add reference sections to all code files
- Verify reference integrity
- Implement automated tools to maintain references
- Update build and CI processes as needed

### Phase 4: Documentation Completion (Week 7-8)
- Identify documentation gaps
- Create missing documentation
- Review and improve existing documentation
- Train team on new documentation practices

## Tooling Support

- Create scripts to validate reference integrity
- Implement pre-commit hooks to ensure reference sections are maintained
- Develop documentation generators that understand the new structure
- Consider integrating with existing documentation tools

## Developer Guidelines Update

The existing coding guidelines will be updated to include:
- How to properly document new code
- How to maintain the reference system
- Templates for each document type
- Review process for documentation
- Standards for documentation quality

## Success Metrics

We will consider this reorganization successful when:
- 100% of code directories have the standard folder structure
- 90% of code files include proper reference sections
- Documentation coverage increases by at least 30%
- Developer feedback indicates improved documentation discoverability
- AI coding assistants demonstrate improved context awareness

## Conclusion

This reorganization will significantly improve our codebase's maintainability and documentation. By creating a consistent structure and implementing a robust reference system, we'll make it easier for developers to find relevant information and for AI tools to provide better assistance.
