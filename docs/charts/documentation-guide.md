# Guide to Writing Documentation for Devize

Good documentation is essential for helping users understand and effectively use Devize. This guide outlines our approach to documentation and provides guidelines for contributors.

## Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows these core principles:

1. **User-Centered**: Focus on what users need to know, not how the code works internally.
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple examples, then gradually introduce more complex features.
3. **Contextual**: Explain concepts in relation to the rest of the library and visualization principles.
4. **Practical**: Include real-world examples that users can adapt to their needs.
5. **Comprehensive**: Cover all features, but prioritize common use cases.

## Documentation Structure

The Devize documentation is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Getting Started

Introductory material for new users:
- Installation and setup
- Basic concepts
- First visualization
- Core principles

### 2. Guides

Conceptual explanations and tutorials:
- Data binding
- Scales and axes
- Layout and positioning
- Interactivity
- Responsive design
- Accessibility
- Performance optimization

### 3. API Reference

Detailed documentation of all components:
- Core API
- Visualization types
- Components
- Utilities

### 4. Examples

Complete examples showing how to use Devize:
- Basic charts
- Complex visualizations
- Interactive dashboards
- Integration examples

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice and Tone

- Use a friendly, conversational tone
- Address the reader directly using "you"
- Be concise but thorough
- Avoid jargon when possible, but explain domain-specific terms when necessary

### Structure

- Start with a clear, concise overview
- Use headings to organize content hierarchically
- Include a "Basic Usage" section with a simple example
- Follow with more detailed explanations and examples
- End with related resources and next steps

### Code Examples

- Start with simple, minimal examples
- Include comments for clarity
- Show complete, working code that users can copy and use
- Progressively build up to more complex examples
- Include expected output or describe what the code does

## Component Documentation Template

When documenting a visualization component, follow this template:

```markdown
# Component Name

Brief description of what the component is and what it's used for.

## Overview

More detailed explanation of the component's purpose, when to use it, and its key features.

## Basic Usage

```javascript
// Simple example code
```

Brief explanation of what this example does.

## Core Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| property1 | type | Description | default |
| property2 | type | Description | default |

## Feature Sections

Detailed explanations of key features with examples.

## Customization Examples

More complex examples showing various customization options.

## Related Components

```

## Documentation Best Practices

### Contextual References

Always provide context by referencing related documentation:

- Link to prerequisite concepts
- Reference related components
- Point to guides that explain underlying concepts
- Suggest alternative approaches when appropriate

### Visual Examples

Include visual examples whenever possible:

- Screenshots of rendered visualizations
- Diagrams explaining concepts
- Animated GIFs for interactive features
- Live examples when the documentation format supports it

### Accessibility

Ensure documentation is accessible:

- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include alt text for images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make code examples screen reader-friendly

### Versioning

Clearly indicate version-specific information:

- Note when features were introduced
- Highlight breaking changes
- Provide migration guidance when applicable

## Review Process

All documentation should go through these review steps:

1. **Technical accuracy**: Ensure all information is correct
2. **Completeness**: Verify that all relevant information is included
3. **Clarity**: Check that explanations are clear and understandable
4. **Examples**: Confirm that examples work as expected
5. **Consistency**: Ensure consistency with other documentation
6. **Proofreading**: Check for grammatical errors and typos

## Contributing Documentation

To contribute to Devize documentation:

1. Identify gaps or areas for improvement
2. Follow the templates and guidelines in this document
3. Submit a pull request with your changes
4. Respond to feedback during the review process
