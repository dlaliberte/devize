1. Dependencies: Both transformation and test files will depend on the TypeScript language and Node.js runtime environment. The server file will also depend on Node.js.

2. Exported Variables: The transformation files will likely export classes or functions for each transformation type (LinearTransformation, LogTransformation, DiscreteTransformation). These will be imported and used in the corresponding test files.

3. Data Schemas: The transformation files will likely define and use a common data schema for representing transformations. This schema will also be used in the test files to create test data.

4. DOM Element IDs: As this is a server-side Node.js application, there will likely be no DOM elements involved.

5. Message Names: If the application uses a messaging system, there may be shared message names between the transformation files and the server file. For example, a "TRANSFORM" message could be sent from the server to trigger a transformation.

6. Function Names: The transformation files will likely define transformation functions (e.g., transformLinear, transformLog, transformDiscrete) that are used in the test files. The server file may also use these functions to perform transformations on the server side.

7. Shared Libraries: All files will likely share some common libraries, such as the TypeScript compiler, the Node.js runtime, and any utility libraries used for data manipulation or testing. The test files will also depend on the Playwright and Sinon libraries for testing.

8. Package.json: This file will list all the dependencies of the project, including TypeScript, Node.js, Playwright, and Sinon.

9. tsconfig.json: This file will contain configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler, which will be used by all TypeScript files in the project.
