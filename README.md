# Devize: Declarative Data Visualization Library

**Devize** is a powerful and flexible data visualization library designed to make the process of creating intricate and interactive visualizations a breeze. With a focus on declarative representation of constraints, Devize empowers you to effortlessly generate stunning data-driven visualizations in both 2D and 3D environments.

(Note: this is entirely imaginary so far...)

## Key Features

- **Declarative Constraints:** Devize's core strength lies in its declarative representation of constraints. Define scaling, translation, and arbitrary relationships between data values, providing granular control over visualization elements.

- **Flexible Layouts:** Create intricate layouts by specifying arbitrary relationships between data, allowing you to design compelling visual narratives.

- **Streamlined Data Processing:** Seamlessly input, analyze, and transform data streams to integrate them into your visualizations.

- **Interactive User Experience:** Devize empowers you to engage your audience with interactive visualizations. Enable user interaction, explore data, and gain insights through dynamic experiences.

- **2D and 3D Graphics:** Leverage Devize's capabilities to craft both 2D and 3D visualizations, opening up new dimensions for data exploration.

- **Smooth Animations:** Bring your visualizations to life with smooth animations that enhance storytelling and data communication.

## Getting Started

To get started with Devize, follow these steps:

1. Install Devize using your preferred package manager:
   ```bash
   npm install devize  # or yarn add devize
   ```

2. Import Devize into your project:
   ```typescript
   import Devize from 'devize';
   ```

3. Begin crafting your declarative visualizations using the Devize API. Consult the documentation for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import Devize from 'devize';

// Define your data streams and constraints
const dataStreams: any[] = [
// Define data streams here
];

const constraints: any[] = [
// Define constraints here
];

// Create a new visualization instance
const visualization = new Devize(dataStreams, constraints);

// Render the visualization to a specified target element
visualization.renderTo('#visualization-container');
```
